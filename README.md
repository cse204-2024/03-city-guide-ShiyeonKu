This is a city/ art museum guide for Chicago. Many of the required elements (such as links, table, and maps) are inside the box models that will appear after you click the options on the bottom of the page. The banner element is not fixed, but I use several fixed positioned elements within this html/css file. I have discuess with the professor and noted that the usage of relative positioning of the banner is ok because I display knoweldge of fixed positioning in other elements.
