This is a city/ art museum guide for Chicago. Many of the required elements (such as links, table, and maps) are inside the box models that will appear after you click the options on the bottom of the page. The "header" or banner is relative to accomodate with the position of the itmes but the navigation "header" is fixed position. All of the images are from Google images.
